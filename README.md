OpenStreetMap (OSM) geocoder
======================

Main purpose of this project is easy to use geocoder/geoindexer.

Project consists of two parts: Gazetteer and GazetteerWeb

Gazetteer
=========

Gazetteer used to parse *osm* data and do all dirty work with geometry.

> there may be a non-deterministic behaviour in case of multipolygon geometry;
extra work ([tests](https://github.com/vasnake/gazetteer/blob/bea14217a0d54df8333da57de42cc70a52490438/gazetteer/src/test/scala/me/osm/gazetteer/striper/builders/BuildUtilsTest.scala#L160-L184)) required

You can use Gazetteer as standalone *osm* processor, to dump addresses from *osm*.

You can ignore GazetteerWeb and use data in your own geocoding/geosearching applications.
Take an osm.bz2 dump and generate `json` with

* full geocoded buildins
* full geocoded POIs
* streets
* cyties
* administrative boundaries

You could find data extracts here: http://data.osm.me/dumps/

GazetteerWeb
============

GazetteerWeb is a second part of the project. 
You may take it as example implementation of search engine for Gazetteer generated data or use it for your own purposes.
